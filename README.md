# Mission to Mars

## Project Overview
To automate a web browser to visit different websites to extract data about the Mission to Mars. It will be stored in a NoSQL database, and then the data will be rendered in a web application created with Flask. The completed work will be displayed in your portfolio.

### Resources
- Data Source: [NASA Mars News](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/) , [Space Images](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/?search=&category=Mars) , [Mars Facts](http://space-facts.com/mars/) , [Mars' Hemispheres](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars)
- Software: Visual Studio Code 1.40.2, Flask, MongoDB, Splinter, ChromeDriver, BeautifulSoup
- Python Libraries: Pandas, Datetime

## Challenge Overview
To adjust the current Mission to Mars web app to include all four of the hemispheres images. Requires additional scraping code to pull the high-resolution images, updating Mongo to include the new data, and altering the design of her web app to accommodate these images.

### Mission to Mars Browser
Below is an image of the Mission to Mars web browser. Please note that the facts table is not displayed - worked with multiple T.A.'s to troubleshoot the issue and it could not be resolved at this time. Possibly a problem specific to Windows users.
